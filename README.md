# Kanban board

This project represent a kanban board application, it was built to prove my skills
with JavaScript and HTML/CSS which I gained in the FiiPractic Workshop "JavaScript
Fundamentals" by Cognizant SoftVision in March-April 2021.

With this project and others coding exercises (which are not in this repository) 
I managed to get first place at the end of the course.


## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Ability to create, modify, delete: boards, columns and tasks
- Drag and drop task from a column to another
- Mobile responsive
- Search bar to filter columns, tasks and assigned persons

## Acknowledgements

The backend API that I used is mockapi, this allows you to easy generate a REST API,
but comes with the drowback that is slow sometimes, so please if the application
works slowly have patience, it's because of the API.
